# Homework 1: OpenCV and Canny Edge Detection

1\. By now you should have both OpenCV and TensorFlow installed. Use you smart phone to take
record a 10-15 second video clip. Convert it to mp4 (mpeg4) format using an online tool. This video
clip will be used for the future testing purpose. For now, just use any media player you may have to
capture a display of the video, e.g., to capture an image from the video clip to be processed in this
homework.

2\. Write a simple OpenCV program based on the reference code in the class repository from the github
whose link is given below.

3\. In your program,

(3.1) display the original image (color) and use OpenCV function to convert the color image to gray
scale image and then display the gray scale image;

(3.2) perform Canny Edge Detection on the gray scale image and display the edge map (the result of
the edge detection) side by side with the original color image and the gray scale image;

4\. Do screen capture with all 3 images mentioned above (original and gray scale images, plus edge
map), be sure your screen capture will have your personal identifier, either your name on the caption of
the display or file folders show your identity. Then covert it to pdf file using any online tool; then

5\. create a folder with the following naming convention and place the openCV source code and the pdf
file into this folder. (Use the following naming convention:

`hw1_opencv_canny_cmpe258_First_last_name_SID`

Then zip it and submit it to the CANVAS.

Refer to Harry Li's Sample Code if needed in sample_code folder:

- [display_image.py](./sample_code/display_image.py)
- [display_canny_edge_image.py](./sample_code/display_canny_edge_image.py)
