# SJSU CMPE258 Deep Learning Dev

SJSU CMPE 258 Deep Learning is based on Professor Harry Li's course and will provide foundation for working on assignments &amp; projects

## Introduction

This Deep Learning Dev repo will provide the foundation for Deep neural networks and their applications to various problems, such as speech recognition, image segmentation, detection and recognition of temporal and spatial patterns, and natural language processing. It covers underlying theory, the range of applications to which it has been applied and learning from very large data sets.

## Learning Milestones

1\. Understand convolution techniques and the kernel construction, as well as LoG, DoG, and Lindberg L(x,y;s) techniques, able to utilize and deploy them for video feature extractions.

2\. Understand convolution neural networks CNN.

3\. Understand the basic building blocks, the composition of them, and the architecture of CNN.

4\. Able to design, build, train and test deep learning CNN for various practical applications.

## Programming Languages & Frameworks

1\. Python

2\. C++ in case you need low level APIs for OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc

3\. OpenCV

4\. Tensorflow Keras API

5\. Optional Embedded Board for Assignment and Projects: Nvidia Jetson NANO

## Lecture Schedule - Action Items

We have online classes Tuesday and Thursday.

For the Recordings in our Lecture Schedule, refer to Dr. Harry Li's GitHub Repo Link: [2022F-102-zoom-cmpe258-2022-9-2.pdf](https://github.com/hualili/opencv/blob/master/deep-learning-2022s/2022F-102-zoom-cmpe258-2022-9-2.pdf)

    - Note: this PDF at the GitHub link will be udpated after Dr. Li completes each lecture.

My goal with each lecture will be to tailor the fundamentals to medical imaging and sometimes skateboarding.
